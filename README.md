# Email_Phishing_Analysis

Incident Response Playbook and Forensics Lab

Project Description and Steps:

1. Simulate a basic incident (e.g., phishing email, ransomware alert).

2. Collect system logs, browser history, and memory dumps (tools: Sysinternals, FTK Imager).

3. Analyze artifacts using forensic tools like Autopsy, Volatility, or Wireshark.

4. Document findings (e.g., indicators of compromise, attack timeline).

5. Develop a step-by-step incident response playbook (detect, contain, eradicate, recover).

6. Evaluate your process using the NIST IR framework.

7. Present a demo of forensics steps and summarize lessons learned.

8. Submit a detailed IR report, tool logs, and your playbook as deliverables.
